        </div>
        <p class="text">Trekking is an adventurous outdoor activity that involves journeying across natural landscapes on foot, often over several days and across challenging terrain. Unlike hiking, which can be a one-day or shorter activity, trekking usually requires stamina, as it often includes trails through mountainous or remote areas and can span across multiple days. <br><br>Beyond fitness, trekking offers a sense of peace and tranquility, allowing trekkers to disconnect from daily routines and enjoy scenic landscapes, wildlife, and fresh air. Many people hike for relaxation, exploration, and to experience breathtaking views at high altitudes or unique terrain.</p>

            <h2 class="desc">SKY DIVING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Skydiving is an exhilarating extreme sport that involves jumping from an aircraft and free-falling before deploying a parachute to control the descent. Typically, skydivers exit the plane from altitudes of 10,000–15,000 feet, giving them an intense, fast-paced experience of free-fall before they open their parachutes at around 5,000 feet. This brief period of free fall provides an unmatched adrenaline rush as the ground rushes up, with speeds often reaching around 120 mph (193 km/h) in a typical belly-down position. <br><br>The sport combines the thrill of speed and altitude with skill and technique.Skydiving is popular worldwide and has developed various disciplines, such as tandem skydiving (where beginners jump attached to an instructor), formation skydiving, and wingsuit flying.</p>

            <h2 class="desc">SCUBA DIVING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Scuba diving is an exhilarating underwater activity that lets divers explore the ocean depths using specialized equipment, including a tank of compressed air, a regulator, and a wetsuit. “Scuba” stands for “Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus,” allowing divers to breathe underwater for extended periods and explore marine life, coral reefs, shipwrecks, and underwater caves. <br><br>One of the most appealing aspects of scuba diving is its immersion into a unique, serene world filled with vibrant colors, diverse marine species, and fascinating underwater landscapes. Whether diving in tropical coral reefs, exploring shipwrecks, or descending into deep blue waters, scuba divers experience an unparalleled connection with nature.</p>

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a thrilling escape into the vastness of the ocean, where every wave presents a unique challenge and an exhilarating rush. As surfers paddle out past the break, they enter a dynamic and ever-changing world where timing, skill, and intuition blend seamlessly. <br> <br>Each ride is a small, intense journey full of unpredictable twists that force surfers to be in the moment. Whether catching a towering wave or simply riding a gentle break, surfing transforms the ocean into a playground of adventure, freedom, and the pure joy of riding one of nature's most awe-inspiring forces. <br> <br>Surfers typically paddle out past breaking waves, wait for an ideal wave, and then use their balance and skill to stand up and ride it back to shore. Mastering the sport requires a mix of physical strength, balance, timing, and ocean knowledge. Surfboards come in various shapes and sizes—from longboards, which are great for stability and smooth turns, to shortboards, designed for speed and quick maneuvers.</p>
